int a =23; and its address is like "0x16f0caf18"
you  can't store in a int datatype like this int b=&a; (This will got an error)
So for this you have to use POINTERS datatype. 
There are many diff pointers like int pointers or int *variable_name; this will save out int a variables address.
And you can not define pointers as a int you will get an error like
int a=23;
int *ad=&a;
ad=1000; this will got an error.
Now if you want to save this *ad pointers value to another pointer so simply you can do this using
int **add=&ad;
Now if you want to see what is the value that pointer holding you can see using 
cout<<*ad;
Exm:
int a = 23;
int *ad=&a;
cout<<ad<<endl;
cout<<*ad<<endl;
int **add=&ad;
cout<<add<<endl;
cout<<*add<<endl;
cout<<**add;
